# Prototype Submission Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete prototype submission system has been implemented with Firebase integration and team verification.

## What Was Created

### 1. Firebase Integration (`lib/firebase/prototypeSubmission.ts`)
A new Firebase module for handling prototype submissions with the following features:

#### Key Functions:

**`verifyTeamAndLeader(teamName, teamLeaderEmail)`**
- Checks if the team exists in the "teams" collection
- Verifies that the email matches the registered team leader
- Returns validation status with appropriate error messages

**`hasTeamSubmitted(teamName)`**
- Checks if a team has already submitted a prototype
- Prevents duplicate submissions

**`submitPrototype(prototypeData)`**
- Main submission function with full validation flow:
  1. Verifies team exists and email matches
  2. Checks for duplicate submissions
  3. Saves to "prototypes" collection if all checks pass
- Returns success/error messages for user feedback

**`getTeamSubmissions(teamName)`**
- Utility function to retrieve all submissions for a specific team

### 2. Database Structure

#### New Collection: `prototypes`
Each document contains:
```javascript
{
  teamName: string,
  googleDriveLink: string,
  teamLeaderEmail: string,
  additionalNotes: string (optional),
  teamId: string (reference to teams collection),
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  status: string // "submitted", "under-review", "accepted", "rejected"
}
```

### 3. Validation Flow

```
User Submits Form
       â†“
Step 1: Verify Team Name Exists
       â†“ (if not found)
       â””â†’ Error: "Team name not found. Please register your team first."
       â†“ (if found)
Step 2: Verify Email Matches Team Leader
       â†“ (if doesn't match)
       â””â†’ Error: "Team leader email does not match."
       â†“ (if matches)
Step 3: Check for Duplicate Submission
       â†“ (if already submitted)
       â””â†’ Error: "Your team has already submitted a prototype."
       â†“ (if not submitted)
Step 4: Save to Firestore
       â†“
Success: "Prototype submitted successfully! ðŸŽ‰"
```

### 4. Error Messages

The system provides clear, user-friendly error messages:

- **Team Not Found**: "Team name not found. Please register your team first before submitting a prototype."
- **Email Mismatch**: "Team leader email does not match. Only the registered team leader can submit prototypes."
- **Duplicate Submission**: "Your team has already submitted a prototype. Multiple submissions are not allowed."
- **Success**: "Prototype submitted successfully! ðŸŽ‰"

### 5. UI Enhancements

Added helpful guidance to the form:
- Info banner explaining registration requirement
- Helper text under Team Name field
- Helper text under Team Leader Email field
- Real-time error/success message display

## Security Features

âœ… **Team Verification**: Only registered teams can submit
âœ… **Leader Authorization**: Only the registered team leader can submit
âœ… **Duplicate Prevention**: Each team can submit only once
âœ… **Data Validation**: All fields are trimmed and validated
âœ… **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and user feedback

## Integration with Existing System

- Uses the same Firebase configuration as team registration
- References the existing "teams" collection for validation
- Maintains consistent naming conventions and code structure
- Follows the same error handling patterns

## Testing Checklist

Before going live, test these scenarios:

1. âœ… Submit with unregistered team name â†’ Should fail
2. âœ… Submit with wrong team leader email â†’ Should fail
3. âœ… Submit with correct team and email â†’ Should succeed
4. âœ… Try to submit again with same team â†’ Should fail (duplicate)
5. âœ… Check Firebase console for "prototypes" collection creation
6. âœ… Verify all fields are saved correctly
7. âœ… Test form validation (empty fields, invalid URLs, etc.)

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure your `.env.local` file has these Firebase variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add ability to update submission (if allowed)
- Add file upload for documents
- Send email confirmation after submission
- Admin dashboard to review submissions
- Status tracking for teams

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `lib/firebase/prototypeSubmission.ts` - Firebase integration
- `components/sections/PrototypeSubmissionForm.tsx` - Form component
- `app/prototype-submission/page.tsx` - Submission page

### Modified:

**Ready to Use!** ðŸš€

The prototype submission system is now fully functional and ready for testing!
